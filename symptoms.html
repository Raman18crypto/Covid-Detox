        <h1>Symptoms</h1>

        <p>

            In response to COVID-19, countries across the globe have implemented a range of public health and
            socialmeasures, including

            movement restrictions, partial closure or closure of schools and businesses, quarantine in
            specificgeographic areas and international

            travel restrictions. As the local epidemiology of the disease changes, countries will adjust (i.e. loosen or
            reinstate) these measures

            accordingly. As transmission intensity declines, some countries will begin to gradually re-open workplacesto
            maintain economic

            activity. This requires establishing protective measures, including directives and capacity to promote
            andenable standard COVID19

            prevention in terms of physical distancing, hand washing, respiratory etiquette and, potentially,
            thermalmonitoring, as well as

            monitoring compliance with these measures.

            <p>

                Self-isolation is an important measure taken by those who have COVID-19 symptoms to avoid infecting
                others in the community, including family members.

                Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at
                home and does not go to work, school or public places.

                This can be voluntarily or based on his/her health care provider’s recommendation. However, if you live
                in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.

                Seek medical help. When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre
                distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help
                the child stick to this advice.

                If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following: If a person is in
                self-isolation, it is because he/she is ill but not severely ill (requiring medical attention)

                The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness.

                Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal
                congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or
                discoloration of fingers or toes.

                These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild
                symptoms.

                Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment.

                Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty
                breathing.

                        Many communities have limits on how many people can attend events and gatherings or enter
                        restaurants and bars.

                        And many schools​ and universities have reduced close contact by providing online learning.

                        When close interaction with others is likely, such as essential trips to the grocery store or
                        gas station,

                        at a gathering, the CDC recommends wearing a cloth face covering over your mouth and nose and
                        staying at least 6 feet away from others.
